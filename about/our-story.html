    <div class="story-container">

      <!-- Intro Paragraph -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <p>Grid Digitals was created from a simple observation: most businesses struggle with digital growth not because they lack effort, but because they lack structure.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Challenge Paragraph -->
      <div class="story-block highlight-block">
        <p>As more businesses moved online, the number of digital tools, platforms, and services increased rapidly — becoming easier to access but harder to manage. Websites were built in isolation, marketing efforts didn’t connect to data, and analytics and automation tools were added without a system to tie everything together. While everything promised growth, the result was often slow, inconsistent, and difficult to control.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Larger Companies Comparison -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <p>At the same time, larger companies approached digital growth very differently. They invested in departments, processes, and internal systems that ensured every part of their digital operation worked together. Strategy, execution, data, and optimization were coordinated across teams. Growth was deliberate, measurable, and controlled.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Gap & Solution -->
      <div class="story-block highlight-block">
        <p>Smaller and growing businesses rarely had access to that level of structure. Grid Digitals was formed to close that gap. Instead of treating digital growth as a collection of tasks, Grid Digitals was built around a systems-first approach — one that focuses on how strategy, execution, tools, and data connect over time. The goal was never just to “do digital work,” but to ensure that every piece of work contributes meaningfully to long-term growth.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Focus & Approach -->
      <div class="story-block">
        <p>From the beginning, the focus has been on building clarity, control, and consistency into how businesses grow online. That means designing solutions that are deliberate, measurable, and scalable — not dependent on constant short-term fixes.</p>
      </div>

      <!-- Vision -->
      <div class="story-block highlight-block">
        <p>Today, Grid Digitals continues to evolve with a long-term vision in mind: to transform structured thinking into integrated digital products and tools that businesses can use to manage growth and operations more effectively.</p>
        <p>The work being done now is foundational. Each project, system, and framework contributes to a larger goal — making digital growth organized, connected, and accessible for businesses that want to grow with confidence.</p>
